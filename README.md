# My First Personal Project

## **A Manhua Reading List Application**

A *manhua reading list application* is meant to keep track of a user's reading collection of manhuas. A manhua is a comic 
genre originated in China. The application can be used by users to keep record of any reading materials as desired, 
however I am targeting this application to track a list of manhuas, more specifically for an audience that reads 
translated manhuas. 

This project idea arose from the struggle that I have seen manhua readers like me encounter. This struggle is to 
keep track of the manhuas I read because these can be found on different online sources where other members of the 
community translate for free. Likewise, manhuas are released per chapter rather than complete, thus keeping track of 
which chapter I last read is easy to forget. Sometimes I even forget which manhuas I am reading from many. Thus, this 
project interests me because the more I find manhuas to read from numerous sources, the more difficult it is to keep 
track of my reading. Hence, I hope to solve my problem through this project for personal use, and I hope to help other 
readers in the same situation.
