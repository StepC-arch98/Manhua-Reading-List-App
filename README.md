# My First Personal Project

## A Manhua Reading Tracker

A manhua reading tracker is meant to track a reading collection of manhuas. A manhua is a comic genre produced in China. 
The application can be used to keep record of other reading 
materials as desired, however I am narrowing this application to track only manhuas, but
more specifically for an audience that reads translated manhuas. 

This idea arose from the struggle that I have seen other manhua readers like me 
encounter. This struggle is
to keep track of the manhuas a person reads because these can be found from so many different websites where other 
members of the community
translate for free, rather than found on a single
reading
application. Likewise, because they are released per chapter rather than as a whole like books, keeping track of which
chapter I last read is tiresome. Thus, this project interests
me because the more I find manhuas to read, and from different sources, the more difficult it is to track all the 
manhuas I read and have read. Hence, I hope that by solving a problem of mine by creating a project for my own use,
 I can also help others in the same situation.
